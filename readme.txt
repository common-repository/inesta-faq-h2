== Description ==
**Inesta FAQ H2** is a lightweight plugin designed to enhance your Yoast or Power Pack FAQ blocks by converting the default question labels from `<span>` elements to `<h2>` headings. This helps improve SEO by ensuring better use of semantic headings and can enhance accessibility for screen readers.

### Key Features

### How It Works
